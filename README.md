## Rankings

1. Seaborn. It looks good and was the easiest to use. It had high visibility for
   text and subtle grid lines, and it was very straightforward to make.
1. Matplotlib. It looks very plain, but was simple to implement. It didn't
   require any extra imports.
1. Plotly. While it looks good, it had low text visibility and was difficult to
   save as a png rather than an html file.
